### Project Objective ###
This is Ting's project 1 assignment. This is a porfolio website to demonstrate the projects Iâ€™ve worked on before as a frontend engineer. It is also a walkthrough of the projects that I dedicated my thoughts to. Hopefully the project can also attract people with same interests.
